## Introduction
Python script that helps you send commands to multi devices simultaneously.

## Requirement
- Python 3.6+
+ If you are using Python 3.5 and lower, just change `print(f"")` function to `print("")`.
- Install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use
- You need 3 files:
  * One include all your IP addresses, 1 IP per line
  * One include your SSH username and password to log in seperated by comma.
  * And one include all your commands you want to send, 1 command per line. **Note that the final line is a empty line**.
- Change your 3 file paths in `config.py`
- Run `main.py`

## Note
- You might need to change the condition of checking invalid command in `ssh_connection.py` because it is different between different operating systems.
